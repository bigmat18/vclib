The Visual Computing Library is a C++20 modern, multi-platform Mesh and Geometry Processing library.

The library is divided in several modules, each one with a specific purpose:
  - **Core**: contains the basic core library, that is templated header only and contains the basic data structures and algorithms; all the other modules depend on this one.
  - **External**: contains algorithms and data structures that use external libraries, like VCG, etc.
  - **Processing**: contains algorithms for high level mesh and geometry processing tasks that can be used as black boxes plugins.
  - **Render**: contains the rendering library, that allows to render meshes using different rendering engines and different window managers and GUI libraries.

All the modules can be found in the [vclib](vclib) directory, and can be built separately.

By default, the library is built with the `Core` module only, but you can enable the other modules by setting the `VCLIB_BUILD_MODULE_<module>` CMake variable to `ON`.

## Install

The core module of library is header only, therefore to install it you just need to add the `vclib/core/include` directory in your
`INCLUDE_PATH`.
Otherwise, you can use the library by using the `cmake` command `add_subdirectory`, by adding the path to this repository
in your `cmake` project. CMake will create a target called `vclib`, that you can link using the `target_link_libraries` command.

## Compiler support

VCLib requires recent compiler versions in order to build the newly features of the C++20 language, that have been recently integrated in the major compilers.

VCLib currently builds with the following compilers:
  - GCC 13.3 (default in Ubuntu 24.04)
  - CLang 16 (XCode 15.0 on MacOS)
  - MSVC 19.36 (Visual Studio 2022)

There is no guarantee that old compiler versions are capable to build the library.

If you use CMake, the minimum required version is 3.24.

## C++20

VCLib is designed to work with the most recent features of C++20:
  - Concepts
  - Ranges and Views

In the future, when CMake will add stable support to C++20 modules, the library will be refactored and will use only modules,
avoiding whenever is possible the usage of `#include`.

## Documentation

Right now, the library is a work in progress, and therefore is a work in progress also the documentation.

The best way to learn how the library works is to look at the code in the [examples](examples), which is built at every commit and therefore it is guaranteed to work.

A first draft of the (not up-to-date) documentation of the library can be found [here](https://alemuntoni.github.io/vclib/).

You can build the documentation using doxygen (tested on 1.9.1 version):

```
doxygen docs/Doxyfile
```

Be sure to call doxygen from the root directory of the repository, otherwise the paths in the Doxyfile will be wrong.

The output will be placed in the `docs/_doxygen/html` directory.

## License

The library is under the [MPL2 license](LICENSE).
