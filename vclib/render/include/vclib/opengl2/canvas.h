/**
 * @brief The Canvas class describes a canvas on which opengl2 can draw.
 *
 * Its usage requires to have a window object that can be used to initialize
 * the canvas. The window object is not managed by the Canvas class, and can be
 * managed by any of the windowing systems or libraries that allow to retrieve
 * the native window handle (e.g. Qt, GLFW...).
 *
 * You can create your custom bgfx canvas class by inheriting from this class
 * and passing to the constructor the native window handle and the window size.
 * Alternatively to the constructor, you can also use the init() method to
 * initialize the canvas (if the required parameters are not available at
 * construction time).
 *
 * This class does not provide a render loop, that must be implemented in one of
 * the derived classes. The render loop must call the frame() member function at
 * the end of each frame, after all the bgfx rendering commands have been
 * issued.
 *
 * The opengl2 rendering code should be implemented in the virtual member
 * function draw(), that must be reimplemented in the derived classes. This
 * method is called by the frame() method (that must be called in the render
 * loop).
 *
 * The class provides two important member functions:
 * - frame(): this function must be called by the derived classes at the end of
 * each frame, after all the opengl2 rendering commands have been issued;
