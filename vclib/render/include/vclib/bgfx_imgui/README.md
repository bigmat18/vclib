The source code of this is modified starting from the [bgfx repository](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx), and it is licensed under the BSD 2-Clause License. 

It has been modified mainly with the following goals:
- provide a 'standard' implementation of a bgfx backend for ImGui;
- Remove the dependency on the bgfx example-common library;
- Use the vclib-render stb-TrueType library instead of the one used by bgfx
