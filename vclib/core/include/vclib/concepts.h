 * between all the defined types of the library, and to constrain the input
 * argument types of templated functions and classes.
 *
 * The library provides both generic utility concepts about iterators, pointers
 * or const correctness management, and concepts for types that have been
 * defined in this library. We separate these categories in two subgroups: @ref
 * util_concepts and @ref lib_concepts.
 *
 * This module depends on the @ref types module.

 * You can access all the concepts of VCLib by including `#include
